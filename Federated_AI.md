# 联邦学习

```
Federated learning is a machine learning setting where multiple entities (clients) collaborate in solving a machine learning problem, under the coordination of a central server or service provider. Each client’s raw data is stored locally and not exchanged or transferred; instead, Focused updates are updates narrowly scoped to contain the minimum information necessary for the specific learning task at hand; aggregation is performed as earlier as possible in the service of data minimization.
